Justins notes (9am-11:pm cut off)

Thanks for reviewing. I put about 2.5 hours in, and I'm not quite sure how to finish a task like this in two hours with reasonable quality. I would be interested in understanding how to approach this class with less code in a way that takes under 2 hours (without delegating to roo code or something and crossing your fingers.)

The design is this

CsvAgentCLI (unfinished ) -> CsvProtocolService (tested, http) ->  CsvContext(tested, unittests)


quick_tools.py -- A CLI service that I used to unpack the data. I always make one of these to hold manual commands

csv_mcp.py - class CsvContext - A class that can wire up a csv file, and provides well behaved methods to interact with it, given a path. Static class.
csv_mcp.py - class CsvProtocolService - The protocol that sits on top of CsvContext

By seperating context and procotol, we can both bind CsvContext into many apps (and tests), but we can also swap MCP protocol layers pretty easily.

Tests:

I like building things in layers. That way I can peel back layers in testing. This is also the reason for wrapping classes as BaseService, as when I do I can jump into CLI to test classes quickly whenever I want.

Unit tests:
- context_tests.py - bare tests of the data interface
- mcp_tests.py - tests that verify the mcp http interface is working

Work remaining: (I would guess another 2-4 hours at my current pace)
- Agent interface (started)
- Agent unit tests (adversarial llm tests )
- Package structure, directory structure

Full disclosure:

- I heavily used nodejobs (pip install nodejobs) in this solution. I am the author of this job manager and cli wrapper. its free for public use for any purpose.
- (I just cant use subprocess or other job managers, they all annoy me, and I like that nodejobs is a psycho about job killing / cleanup / registering for debugging)

Thanks for the attention!
